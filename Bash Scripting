Bash Battle Arena!
This game comes at the end of the Bash scripting module designed to solidify the material learnt in the module and also fill in any gaps of knoweledge.
I will document my progress as i try to coomplete as many levels as possible!

Level 1:
Mission: Create a directory named Arena and then inside it, create three files: warrior.txt, mage.txt, and archer.txt. List the contents of the Arena directory.

Level 1 complete! I started by making a directory named "Arena" using the mkdir command. I then created a simple script and named it "level1". This is what i entered:

#!/bin/bash

#level_1


touch warrior.txt mage.txt archer.txt

mv warrior.txt mage.txt archer.txt /home/ubuntu/Arena

Level 2:

Mission: Create a script that outputs the numbers 1 to 10, one number per line.

So this one was quite straight forward, i just created simple script that adds 1 to the count every time. This was the script i used:

#!/bin/bash

count=1

while [ $count -le 10 ]
do
echo "Number: $count"
((count++))
done

The outcome was as follows:

Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
Number: 6
Number: 7
Number: 8
Number: 9
Number: 10  


Level 3:

Mission: Write a script that checks if a file named hero.txt exists in the Arena directory. If it does, print Hero found!; otherwise, print Hero missing!.

So this one was also quite straight forward i used a simple script using conditions to look for the hero.txt file:

#!/bin/bash


if [ -f ./Arena/hero.txt ]
then
        echo "Hero found!"
else
        echo "Hero missing!"
fi

Level 4: 

Mission: Create a script that copies all .txt files from the Arena directory to a new directory called Backup.

I completed this one by using a very simple script but an effective one:

mkdir Backup

cp Arena/*.txt Backup

Level 5:

This one was quite the challenge but managed to get it done in the end using this script:

#!/bin/bash


mkdir -p Battlefield
mkdir -p Archive


touch Battlefield/knight.txt Battlefield/sorcerer.txt Battlefield/rogue.txt
if [ -f ./Battlefield/knight.txt ]; then

mv ./Battlefield/knight.txt  Archive
fi
        echo "Contents of Battlefield:"
        ls Battlefield
        echo "Contents of Archive:"
        ls Archive

And the output was:

Contents of Battlefield:
rogue.txt  sorcerer.txt
Contents of Archive:
knight.txt
