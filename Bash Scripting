Bash Battle Arena!
This game comes at the end of the Bash scripting module designed to solidify the material learnt in the module and also fill in any gaps of knoweledge.
I will document my progress as i try to coomplete as many levels as possible!

Level 1:
Mission: Create a directory named Arena and then inside it, create three files: warrior.txt, mage.txt, and archer.txt. List the contents of the Arena directory.

Level 1 complete! I started by making a directory named "Arena" using the mkdir command. I then created a simple script and named it "level1". This is what i entered:

#!/bin/bash

#level_1


touch warrior.txt mage.txt archer.txt

mv warrior.txt mage.txt archer.txt /home/ubuntu/Arena
